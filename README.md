Assignment Description

This project contains solutions to two parts of a code assignment that involves simple operations in Python:

    Part 1: Summing given values by converting them to integers where necessary.
    Part 2: Checking whether a computed sum exists as a substring within a given text.

Requirements

    Python 3.x

Instructions

    Part 1: Sum Values as Integers
        Given three values:
            A = -5 (integer)
            B = '8' (string)
            C = 7.6 (float)
        Convert all values to integers where necessary and compute their sum.
        Store the result in a variable named TOTAL.

    Expected Output:

    -5 + 8 + 7.6 = 10

-5 + 8 + 7.6 = 10

Part 2: Check Substring in Text

    Use the computed sum (TOTAL) and check if its value exists as a substring in the provided text: "I wrote my very first program at age 10!".
    If TOTAL exists in the text, set the variable OUTPUT to "true that".
    If TOTAL does not exist in the text, set OUTPUT to "nope".

Expected Output:



    Value of 'TOTAL' exists in string: true that

Running the Code

    Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
    Run the script using the command:

    bash

    python script_name.py

    Replace script_name.py with the name of your Python file.

Example Output

When running the script, you should see the following output:

arduino

-5 + 8 + 7.6 = 10
Value of 'TOTAL' exists in string: true that
